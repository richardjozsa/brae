// D5: every script named validation/*_vs_openfoam.sh must be a REGISTERED, RUNNABLE, ASSERTING gate.
//
// D5 was logged as one dead script. It was 27. Every `*_vs_openfoam.sh` in validation/ that predated the
// cf -> brae rename was unregistered, still pointed at /home/ghost/cudafoam/cf, and printed its comparison
// without ever asserting a tolerance -- so none could run, and none would have failed if it had. A
// directory listing showed 27 OpenFOAM gates that did not exist.
//
// That is the same failure this project keeps finding, one level up: the validation suite was silently
// claiming coverage it did not have, exactly as the solver was silently ignoring inputs it had read. The
// per-run answer to the second was dict_audit; this is the build-time answer to the first.
//
// Three properties, and the third is the one that makes the other two worth anything:
//   1. REGISTERED  -- the name appears in CMakeLists.txt, so ctest actually runs it.
//   2. RUNNABLE    -- no path from the retired `cf` project, which cannot resolve on any machine.
//   3. ASSERTING   -- contains an explicit failure path (exit 1 / sys.exit(1) / a FAIL branch). A gate that
//                     only prints passes forever and is worse than no gate, because it reads as coverage.
//
// Quarantined scripts live under validation/legacy_cf/ and are deliberately NOT checked: they are kept as a
// record of what was once verified, and validation/legacy_cf/README.md names which live gate covers each
// area and which are genuinely uncovered. Moving a script there is a decision to be made in the open, not a
// way to silence this test -- the README is the place that decision is written down.
