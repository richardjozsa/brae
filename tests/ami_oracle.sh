# that CATCHES real AMI-coupling bugs -- both my fixes (bounded-div missing the AMI-face flux; deferred-rotation
# leaking into UEqn.H()) lived in shared distributed code, so a np2-vs-np1 oracle passes with both wrong; only

# Both solvers are forced to FULL inner convergence (relTol 0) so a short fixed run is solver-algorithm-independent
# and thus bit-exact at np=1 (single-GPU smoothSolver vs distributed BiCGStab otherwise stop at different residuals).
