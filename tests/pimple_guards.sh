# fvOptions source produces a plausible-looking field that is simply wrong, which is the failure mode brae exists
# to avoid -- so each refusal gets a test, and the control case proves the guards do not fire on a clean case.
#
# The guards run after the dictionary parse and BEFORE the mesh is read, so these fixtures are dicts only: no
# polyMesh, no GPU. The control case is expected to fail too -- but on the missing mesh, further in.
