# Gate: flowRateInletVelocity must be fed the SOLVER's rho, not thermo.rho(), when rho is relaxed.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. OF's flowRateInletVelocityFvPatchVectorField::updateCoeffs sets
#     avgU = -mdot / gSum(rho*magSf)      with rho = patch().lookupPatchField<volScalarField>("rho")
# i.e. the REGISTERED solver rho -- the relaxed field createFields.H builds. That is the same field
# `phiHbyA = fvc::interpolate(rho)*fvc::flux(HbyA)` weights the inlet flux with, so the two cancel:
#     sum_i rho_i|Sf|_i * (-mdot / sum_j rho_j|Sf|_j)  ==  -mdot     exactly, every iteration.
# brae fed avgU thermo.rho() at the boundary while weighting the flux with the relaxed rho. With
# relaxRho = 1 those are the same field and nothing happens. With relaxRho < 1 the cancellation breaks,
# the inlet stops delivering the prescribed mass flow, and the resulting net mass imbalance drives the
# pressure LEVEL. Measured on this case before the fix:
#     inlet flux   -0.100024  -0.099690  -0.104411  -0.068195   (OF: -0.100000 at every iteration)
#     pre-limit p   102 kPa    100 kPa     163 kPa   -339 kPa    (OF: 99999.7 .. 101911.0, static)
# By iteration 5 p reached +2.34 MPa with 19600 of 28000 cells pinned on the pressureControl limits, and
# the case never converged (p L2rel 5.10e-01). After the fix brae converges in 422 iterations against
# OF's 638, at p 1.53e-03  T 7.91e-04  U 4.87e-03  rho 4.10e-03.
#
# WHY THIS CASE AND NOTHING ELSE. The defect needs BOTH a relaxed rho and a flowRateInletVelocity inlet.
# Every other compressible case in validation/ sets `relaxationFactors { fields { rho 1.0; } }`, where
# the two densities coincide; naca0012 -- the only case with rho 0.01 -- is external aero with
# freestream boundaries and no flow-rate inlet. angledDuct is the sole intersection, which is why this
# survived every existing gate.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS: that brae CONVERGES on this case, and to OF's answer. That is the thing the defect
# took away -- the pre-fix run reached endTime in a period-2 limit cycle at p L2rel 5.10e-01.
#
# WHY NOT A SHORT COLD-START RUN, which would be much cheaper. Measured: OF's own cold start saturates
# the pressureControl ceiling for the first dozens of iterations (`pressureControl: p max 1.47598e+06`
# at iteration 1, decaying 1.15e6 -> 835k -> 616k -> ...), and at iteration 8 OF has 17600 of 28000
# cells pinned at exactly 150000 against brae's 17200. Comparing there compares two clamped transients,
# where most of the field is the same saturated constant on both sides and the rest is path noise --
# it neither reflects the defect nor holds a tolerance. "p stays inside the limiter window" is likewise
# NOT an invariant on this case: OF violates it too. Convergence is the honest discriminator.
#
# IT ALSO ASSERTS THE INVARIANT DIRECTLY, on every time directory brae writes:
#     |sum_{f in inlet} phi_f| == massFlowRate
# This is the exact statement of the fix and it is exact arithmetic, not a tuned tolerance -- the two
# densities cancel or they do not. It goes red the moment someone feeds thermo.rho() back into the
# velocity BC, instead of waiting for the pressure to diverge hundreds of iterations later. (Measured on
# brae's own output after the fix: sum(phi_inlet) = -1.000000000000e-01 against mdot 0.1, |sum|-mdot = 0.)
