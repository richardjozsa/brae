// brae DeviceHalo: device-resident processor halo exchange over NVSHMEM.
//
// Manages ALL of a rank's processor interfaces together (one symmetric send/recv buffer pair, one barrier) --
// the device counterpart of the host ProcessorInterface loop (init-all / wait / update-all). The transport is
// the NVSHMEM on-stream host API (nvshmemx_putmem_on_stream + nvshmemx_barrier_all_on_stream), so the pack and
// scatter are plain CUDA kernels and NOTHING needs relocatable device code. The fully device-initiated,
// pack-fused, signalled variant is a Phase-5 performance change behind this same interface.
//
// Symmetric-heap layout: the send/recv buffers are sized to the MAX total interface faces across ALL PEs, so
// the collective nvshmem_malloc is symmetric and recvBuf.data() is the same symmetric address on every PE.
// Interface i occupies [recvOffset_[i], +size_[i]). A one-time MPI offset exchange tells each neighbour where
// in our recv buffer it should write (remoteOffset_[i] is where WE write in the neighbour's buffer).
