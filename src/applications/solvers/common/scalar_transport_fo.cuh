// functionObjects::scalarTransport -- OF src/functionObjects/solvers/scalarTransport.C.
//
// WHAT OF DOES, and what is reproduced here. OF's compressible branch is
//
//     fvm::ddt(rho, s) + fvm::div(phi, s, divScheme) - fvm::laplacian(D, s, laplacianScheme)
//         == fvOptions(rho, s)
//     sEqn.relax(relaxCoeff);  iterate until initialResidual() < tol
//
// On a STEADY solver the ddt term drops out, leaving div - laplacian, which is exactly the shape
// deviceSolveScalarTransport already assembles for k, epsilon, omega and the energy -- so the tracer
// goes through the case's own discretisation rather than a private one.
//
// LOOKED UP BY NAME, LATE. Everything this needs comes from the ObjectRegistry on FIRST EXECUTE, not
// from references captured at construction. That is OF's own arrangement (Time IS an objectRegistry;
// scalarTransport.C's transportedField() creates or finds its field on first use), and it is what makes
// construction order irrelevant: Time can be built at start-up -- so the functionObject report survives
// a later refusal -- while the solver it will drive is built 200 lines further down.
//
// NOT YET READY is not an error. If the registry has no solver at the first execute() the object simply
// defers; a steady solver registers before its loop, so this resolves on the first iteration.
//
// SCOPE, and what is refused rather than approximated:
//   * D: OF picks between a constant, a named nut field, and alphaD*nu + alphaDt*nut (scalarTransport.C
//     D()). ONLY the constant branch is built; the caller refuses the others BY NAME. Substituting a
//     constant for a nut-based diffusivity would change the answer while appearing to work.
//   * ddt: TRANSIENT IS supported. This object owns the field's old time levels (old/old2/ddt0,
//     device_ddt.cuh:95) and solvePassiveScalar advances them with the SOLVER's time scheme -- a case
//     has one time scheme, and choosing it is not a functionObject's business. On a steady solver the
//     term drops out, exactly as OF's ddt does.
//
// PASSIVE: nothing here writes back into U, p, T, rho or the turbulence, so a case solves identically
// with the tracer present or absent. That is what makes it safe to run from the functionObject
// lifecycle rather than from inside the SIMPLE loop.
